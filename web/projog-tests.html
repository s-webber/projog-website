<p>
As well as unit tests, written using the JUnit framework, <a href="http://www.projog.org/" title="Prolog logic programming language for the Java platform">Projog</a> also contains system tests.
The system tests are written using a Projog-specific markup and are contained in the comments of Prolog code.
</p>
<h3>org.projog.test</h3>
<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/s-webber/projog-test"><code>projog-test</code></a> GitHub project contains classes for
parsing Projog's system test file format and running the tests.
These classes are used for both the system testing and web site documentation generation of the project.

<h3>System Tests File Format</h3>

 <p>
 System test files contain comments which, using a Projog-specific markup, specify queries and their expected results
 embedded in standard Prolog code.
 The system tests provide an efficient, clear and consistent approach to testing that the Projog engine evaluates
 queries correctly without focusing on <i>how</i> it does it.
 </p>
 <p>
 The system tests are stored in two places:
 <ol>
 <li>In text files stored in sub-directories of the project's <a href="https://github.com/s-webber/projog/tree/master/src/test/prolog"><code>src/test/prolog</code></a> directory.</li>
 <li>
 Embedded in the comments of the project's Java files alongside the functionality the system tests are intended to test.
 The system tests are extracted from the Java comments as part of the build process.
 </li>
 </ol>
 </p>
 <p>
 The system tests have two purposes:
 <ol>
 <li>
 To confirm that the Projog software works as required by comparing the
 expected results contained in the system tests against the actual results 
 generated when evaluating the queries.
 </li>
 <li>
 To produce the examples contained in the web based Projog manual.
 For example, the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-webber/projog/master/src/main/java/org/projog/core/predicate/builtin/compare/Between.java">Between.java</a> file gets automatically transformed into the <a href="http://www.projog.org/Between.html">Between.html</a> file as part of the build process.
 </li>
 </ol>
 </p>
 <p>
 Examples of how system tests can be specified using comments (i.e. lines prefixed with a <code>%</code>) are:
 <ol>
 <li>Test that that the query <code>?- test.</code> succeeds once and no attempt will be made to find an alternative solution:
 <div class="example-content"><div class="code">%TRUE test</div></div>
 </li>
 <li>Test that that the query <code>?- test.</code> succeeds once and will fail when an attempt is made to find an alternative solution:
 <div class="example-content"><div class="code">%TRUE_NO test</div></div>
 </li>
 <li>Test that that the query <code>?- test.</code> will fail on the first attempt to evaluate it:
 <div class="example-content"><div class="code">%FAIL test</div></div>
 </li>
 <li>Test that that the query <code>?- test.</code> will succeed three times and there will be no attempt to evaluate it for a fourth time:
 <div class="example-content"><div class="code">
 %?- test<br>
 %YES<br>
 %YES<br>
 %YES
 </div></div>
 </li>
 <li>Test that that the query <code>?- test.</code> will succeed three times and will fail when an attempt is made to evaluate it for a fourth time:
 <div class="example-content"><div class="code">
 %?- test<br>
 %YES<br>
 %YES<br>
 %YES<br>
 %NO
 </div></div>
 </li>
 <li>Test that that the query <code>?- test(X).</code> will succeed three times and there will be no attempt to evaluate it for a fourth time, specifying expectations about variable unification:
 <div class="example-content"><div class="code">
 %?- test(X)<br>
 % X=a<br>
 % X=b<br>
 % X=c
 </div></div>
 The test contains the following expectations about variable unification:
  <ul>
   <li>After the first attempt the variable <code>X</code> will be instantiated to <code>a</code>.</li>
   <li>After the second attempt the variable <code>X</code> will be instantiated to <code>b</code>.</li>
   <li>After the third attempt the variable <code>X</code> will be instantiated to <code>c</code>.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Test that that the query <code>?- test(X,Y).</code> will succeed three times and will fail when an attempt is made to evaluate it for a fourth time, specifying expectations about variable unification:
 <div class="example-content"><div class="code">
 %?- test(X,Y)<br>
 % X=a<br>
 % Y=1<br>
 % X=b<br>
 % Y=2<br>
 % X=c<br>
 % Y=3<br>
 %NO
 </div></div>
 The test contains the following expectations about variable unification:
  <ul>
   <li>After the first attempt the variable <code>X</code> will be instantiated to <code>a</code> and the variable <code>Y</code> will be instantiated to <code>1</code>.</li>
   <li>After the second attempt the variable <code>X</code> will be instantiated to <code>b</code> and the variable <code>Y</code> will be instantiated to <code>2</code>.</li>
   <li>After the third attempt the variable <code>X</code> will be instantiated to <code>c</code> and the variable <code>Y</code> will be instantiated to <code>3</code>.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Test that that the query <code>?- repeat(3), write('hello world'), nl.</code> will succeed three times and there
 will be no attempt to evaluate it for a fourth time, specifying expectations about what should be written to standard output:
 <div class="example-content"><div class="code">
 %?- repeat(3), write('hello world'), nl<br>
 %OUTPUT<br>
 % hello world<br>
 %<br>
 %OUTPUT<br>
 %YES<br>
 %OUTPUT<br>
 % hello world<br>
 %<br>
 %OUTPUT<br>
 %YES<br>
 %OUTPUT<br>
 % hello world<br>
 %<br>
 %OUTPUT<br>
 %YES
 </div></div>
 The test contains expectations that every evaluation will cause the text <code>hello world</code> and a new-line character
 to be written to the standard output stream.
 </li>
 <li>Test that while evaluating the query <code>?- repeat(X).</code> an exception will be thrown with a particular message:
 <div class="example-content"><div class="code">
 %?- repeat(X)<br>
 %ERROR Expected Numeric but got: NAMED_VARIABLE with value: X
 </div></div>
 </li>
 <li>The following would be ignored when running the system tests but would be used
 when constructing the web based documentation to include a link to <code>test.html</code>:
 <div class="example-content"><div class="code">%LINK test</div></div>  
 </li>
 </ol>
